# viz-samples
Vizzes of various types, mostly in R

Each viz type has an associated script.  I will be adding to this repo as I experiment with visualization types.

Any suggested improvements are welcome.  Please be sure to properly comment your additions or changes (and leave the original code for comparison where changes have been made!).  Anything borrowed from elsewhere should be attributed properly in your comments.

Thanks!
